## Project Description
This project is a number system converter application developed as part of the Computer Programming 2 course's midterm Project 3. The application provides functionality to convert numbers between different number systems, including binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

- **GUI Class**: `NumberConverterBoard.java`
  - Contains the graphical user interface (GUI) for the number system converter application.
- **Number Converter Interface**: `NumberConverter.java`
  - Defines methods for converting numbers between different number systems.

## Implementation Details
### `prog2.samcis` Package
- **Number Converter Implementation**: `EquivalentNumbers.java`
  - Implements the `NumberConverter` interface and provides methods for converting numbers between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal representations.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the number system converter application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Hendrizzzz/Computer-Programming-2-Midterm-Project-3-Number-System-Converter-App

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Computer-Programming-2-Midterm-Group-Project-3

3. Compile the Java files:
